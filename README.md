# Introduction:
The provided code demonstrates an implementation of a neural network model to classify credit card transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The dataset used for this task is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle. The code first loads and preprocesses the data, oversamples the minority class, and then trains a neural network model using Keras. The accuracy of the model is evaluated on the testing set, and the performance is visualized using various plots. Finally, a new transaction is provided to the model, and the model predicts whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.

# Description of dataset
The credit card fraud detection dataset is a real-world dataset containing credit card transactions made in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset has a total of 31 columns, of which 28 are anonymized input features labeled V1 through V28, one column containing the transaction time in seconds since the first transaction (Time), one column containing the transaction amount (Amount), and one binary target variable indicating whether the transaction was fraudulent (Class).

The dataset contains a total of 284,807 transactions, of which only 492 (0.172%) are fraudulent. This makes the dataset highly imbalanced, with the majority of transactions being non-fraudulent. The input features have already been preprocessed using PCA to protect sensitive information, so their meaning is not immediately clear.

This dataset is commonly used as a benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of fraud detection models, especially those based on machine learning techniques such as neural networks. The challenge in this dataset is to develop a model that can accurately detect the rare cases of fraud while minimizing false positives on non-fraudulent transactions.

# Result Findings
The trained neural network achieved an accuracy of around 99.93% on the test set. This high accuracy suggests that the model is performing very well on this task of credit card fraud detection.

# Conclusion:
In summary, the provided code demonstrates how to build a neural network model for credit card fraud detection. It shows how to preprocess the data, oversample the minority class to deal with class imbalance, build and train a neural network model using Keras, evaluate the performance of the model on the testing set, and use the model to make predictions on new data. The code can be further improved by tuning the hyperparameters of the model, experimenting with different architectures, and using more advanced techniques for dealing with class imbalance.
